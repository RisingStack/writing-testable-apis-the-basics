# Writing testable APIs

I remember writing my first test-cases - it was anything but a mess. Testing done right is not easy.
It is not just about how you write your tests, but also how you structure your entire codebase.
This post intends to clear that up in the context of REST APIs.

## Unit tests

## Integration tests

## Setting up your test runner

## Making your codebase modular - time for unit tests

## Putting the pieces together - writing integration tests

## Mock out third-party APIs
