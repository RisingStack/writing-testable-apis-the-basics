# Testing APIs

## Sketch

The example code will use koa/express. It does not make a big difference.
If we will have the time we can do it for both.

1. Unit tests in general
2. Integration tests in general
3. How to structure your code, so it can be easily tested
4. Using a test runner (mocha)
5. Writing unit tests
  - how to mock databases (using sinon)
6. Writing integration tests with hippie
  - when writing integration tests, we do not mock out the database
7. Mocking out APIs using nock (example: integration testing microservices)
